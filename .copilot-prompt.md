I have a netgear GS308EP PoE switch and I'd like to control per-port power from an ESP32.  This switch has a web UI but no API.  There is a library available for Python that provides access via web scraping at  https://github.com/foxey/py-netgear-plus; it appears that this behavior could be duplicated using cURL or similar, so we should be able to duplicate the basic functionality in arduino C++.  Provide an arduino library using the same approach used by this python library.  If you need additional information, ask.
